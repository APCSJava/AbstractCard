# Spades
Starter code for the Spades challenge.

This repository provides two complete classes, PlayingCard and Dealer.  Neither of these two classes requires any modification.

The class Spade is provided with a partial implementation, including Javadoc comments suggesting its use.  Classes for other suits are not provided and will need to be generated from scratch.

The class Tester provides sufficient code for testing the Spade class.  Additional tasks are indicated that will finish building and testing the deck once other subclasses are compiled.
